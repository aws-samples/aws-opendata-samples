# How to use data from AWS Open Data program in Amazon Bedrock

The [AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program](https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/open-data-sponsorship-program/) eliminates data acquisition barriers by hosting high-value datasets in the cloud, enabling researchers and analysts to focus on discovery and innovation rather than data management. When data is shared on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), anyone can analyze it and build services on top of it using a broad range of compute and data analytics products, including [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/). AWS provides a catalog of publicly available datasets on AWS through the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/). The registry has over 650 datasets open to the public, such as government data, scientific research, life sciences, climate, satellite imagery, geospatial, and genomic data.

Many government agencies, like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), participate in the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program. NOAA makes data available to the public through the [NOAA Open Data Dissemination (NODD) program](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination). You can [view all of the NODD datasets on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/collab/noaa/). We use NOAA data from the NODD program to demonstrate how customers can use data made available through AWS Open Data in Amazon Bedrock.

In this post, we discuss how to use NOAA datasets in the Registry of Open Data on AWS using [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/). With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can give [foundation models (FMs)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/) and agents contextual information from private and public data sources to deliver more relevant, accurate, and customized responses. With the NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) in particular, you can make information like precipitation and snow depth available to a set of users that might not be comfortable with SQL commands or other tools commonly used to search these types of data. Now nontechnical decision-makers can have access to highly technical data in an accessible and understandable format through a chat-based assistant.
